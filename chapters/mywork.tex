\chapter{My work}
\label{cha:main}
Schema of the final solution, explanation of the flow and how it concretely works. Then, focus on three key components.

\section{Tracking}
\label{sec:tracking}
Introduction to what kind of tracking is needed, what we expect from the devices. Brief explanation of the state of the art of communication technologies (LoRa, SigFox, LTE...) and geolocalization.

\subsection{The market}
\label{sec:track_market}
The study and testing of the alternatives available, maybe a table summarizing the characteristics of each device (type of communication supported, battery, personalization of firmware, cost etc).

\subsection{Pycom}
\label{sec:track_choice}
Why we decided to choose that device.

\subsection{Firmware}
\label{sec:track_firmware}
Life cycle of the device (maybe with a flow chart). Some snippets?

\section{Decentralized architecture}
\label{sec:arch}
Requirements of the architectures, same as \ref{sec:tracking} (what we expect etc)

\subsection{Decentralization alternatives}
\label{sec:alternatives}
Distributed databases, how they reach consensus, blockchain based frameworks

\subsection{HyperLedger}
\label{sec:hyperledger}
Why, description of what it is and how it works etc. Schema with their grammar about our network


\section{Interfaces}
Small section with a bit of reference about the webapps and how they work, what should be allowed. Some snippets can be useful here, explaining how we make use of hyperledger APIs.
