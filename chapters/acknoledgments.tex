\emph{
%  The first thanks goes to Prof. Montresor, for his guidance and constant support during the work of this thesis. His knowledge and patience have been fundamental to achieve a good result. I would also like to thank the Spindox Labs team, for giving me the opportunity of studying and exploring these technologies. I am specially thankful to Filippo, who has been not only a roommate, but also a valuable friend and an endless source of inspiration and advice. His presence accompanied me during my bachelor studies and he totally deserves my gratitude. Last, but not least, a sincere thanks to my family and my girlfriend, for being always by my side and supporting me in every moment of these years.
